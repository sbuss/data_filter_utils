# Summarizing

Accuracy for incongruent and congruent

Congruent if:

box_img == 'redsquare.bmp' && alignment in ['left', 'center']
box_img == 'bluesquare.bmp' && alignment in ['right', 'center']
Morgan thinks center should be with congruent case.
What to do for center? Make it a separate thing?

Reaction time for incog & cog (for both (just accurate responses) and (all responses))

Simon score = incog RT - cog RT (for just accurate reponses)
